Problem 2 :

With previous solution we were off by 2 and that's because of not starting at 1 and 
also we need to switch first and second variables AFTER we check if it's an even
number or not
at the begging, we need to define variables like this:

 long first = 1;
       

 long second = 1;
        
long newNum = 0;
long sum = 0;

while(newNum < 4000000)
{
	if(newNum %2 ==0)
	{
		sum += newNum;
	}
	first = second;
	second = newNum;
}
print("final answer is : ", sum);

PROBLEM 19: 
-----------------
After multiple researches I did, I found out that it will be easy to use .NET API 
to get good day/time API which was very very useful for this problem.

This code will check all days and then it will check if it's a Sunday or not.
At the end it will print the total number of sundays in 20th century.
